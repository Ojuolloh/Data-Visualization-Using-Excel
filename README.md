The data Set was downloaded from Kaggle.
The following were some of the insights that are to be drawn from the Data.

3.Platform Popularity: Which platforms have the highest total sales? How has platform popularity changed over time?
4.Publisher Impact: Which publishers have the most top-selling games? What is the distribution of global sales among different publishers?
5.Regional Preferences: How do video game preferences differ across regions? For example, which games or genres are more popular in Japan compared to North America?
6.Sales Trends Over Time: How have video game sales evolved over the years? Are there any noticeable trends or peaks in certain years?
